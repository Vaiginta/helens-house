INT. XOYO CLUB - NIGHT #1#

The club pulsates with vibrant lights and thunderous music. BEN (30s), lively and uninhibited, navigates through the crowd, a drink in hand.

Ben's eyes lock with a YOUNG WOMAN (20s) in the crowd. They exchange smiles.

In a fast-paced montage, Ben and the Young Woman down shots, dance, share a pill, dance more and kiss. Eventually, Ben and the Young Woman make their way out of the club.

INT. HELEN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM #2#

Sunlight streams through the curtains. Ben's eyes flutter open. He feels an odd weight on his head. Reaching up, he feels the soft fur of a cat nestled atop his head. The cat meows loudly and leaps from his head, dashing across the room.

Ben turns, expecting to see the Young Woman, but instead finds HELEN (30s). Confusion spreads across his face. 

Ben quietly gets out of bed, spots a pile of clothes, and pulls on a snug V-neck T-shirt, clearly meant for a woman. His hairy chest is awkwardly on display, peeking out from the neckline. He attempts to peel the shirt off, but it clings too tightly. 

Helen stirs in the bed. Ben quickly gathers his belongings and heads for the door.

CUT TO:

INT. HELEN'S HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR #3#

Ben rushes down the stairs, heading straight for the exit. He reaches the door, tugs at it, but it won't budge. Ben tries a few more times but to no avail. 

Ben goes to a window. Tries to open it. But like the door, the window resists his efforts, firmly stuck in place.

Suddenly, a sock flies past him.

Ben turns around and sees Helen standing there. She holds a laundry basket. Ben puts on a smile.

BEN
Last night was epic, truly unforgettable. I mean, most of it is a blur, but in the best way possible. I wasn't trying to sneak out. 

Helen picks up a ball of socks from the laundry basket and tosses it at Ben, missing him by inches.

BEN (CONT'D)
Okay, that's not true. I did try to sneak out. I've got this thing at work, a presentation, and my boss—-

Helen throws more socks at Ben, missing him each time.

HELEN
Take whatewer! Microwave, TV, anything. The TV's got a European plug but it’s top-notch. 8K, 10-bit colour. Please, don't rape me!

BEN
Hold on, didn’t we...you know, last night? I'm really sorry, I don't remember your name.

HELEN
Did we what last night?

Helen chucks more socks Ben's way.

BEN
We met at XOYO, right? Shared some Mandy. Came back here.

HELEN
XOYO?

BEN
XOYO, the club. DJ Baba was on, he's huge in Germany. And you had moves, I mean....
(looks at a confused Helen)
It wasn't you, was it? I left XOYO with a different girl. Petite, fiery red hair, absolutely stunning. Is she your flatmate?

HELEN
It's just me here. And Brooks.

BEN
Brooks, the cat.

HELEN
What cat? Brooks is a guinea pig. I’m allergic to cats.

BEN
There was a cat when I woke up. 
(beat)
Am I still tripping?

A brief flashback of Ben and Helen on a restaurant date flickers past. Recognition dawns on Helen's face.

HELEN
You're Ben, right? It’s me, Helen.

Helen looks at Ben, expecting him to recognize her. Ben draws a blank.

BEN
You do look kind of familiar. Or you just remind me of someone else.

HELEN
Tapas bar, ten years ago? You nearly chocked on a meat skewer. I thought we had a really good time. Minus the almost chocking part.

Ben's expression remains blank.

HELEN
We went on a date. You never called.

BEN
I'm sorry about that.

HELEN
Don't need to be sorry. It was just one date.

Ben and Helen stand in an awkward silence.

BEN
I really should get going. Your door is jammed. And the window’s a no-go. 
(realisation strikes him)
Did you kidnap me?

Helen rolls her eyes at the suggestion, moving to the door to unlock it.

BEN
Were you that upset I never called?

HELEN
I didn't kidnap you.

Helen tries the door, but like Ben, finds it immovable. She gives it a firm pull, mirroring Ben's earlier attempts.

Helen then tries several windows, each stubbornly refusing to budge. Her anxiety mounts.

HELEN
What is... what is going on?

Helen looks unsteady in her feet.

BEN
(noticing Helen's unease)
Would you like to sit down?

Ben guides Helen gently by the arm to the couch. As they sit, an unexpected figure stirs beside them. GRAHAM (70s), clad in pyjamas, sits up on the couch. Helen leaps to her feet in shock.

A flashback reveals a younger Graham handing a paper marked with a 'C' to a pleading teenage Helen.

HELEN
Mr. Harry?

Graham appears disoriented.

GRAHAM
Where am I?

BEN
You're in Helen's house. 
(offers his hand)
I'm Ben, by the way.

GRAHAM
(shakes Ben's hand)
Graham. And who's Helen?

HELEN
I was in your class. Year eleven. This is too weird. 

BEN
(to Graham)
Were you at XOYO last night?

GRAHAM
I was at home with my wife. I've taught many Helens over the years. One of them was Helen Marlowe. Heard she's done quite well for herself. Earned a PhD in Quantum physics from Oxford. Top of the class. Entrepreneurial, too. Her company attracted an investment from Bill Gates himself. Quite the brainbox, that one.

As Graham reminisces, Helen's expression turns sour, the weight of the other Helen's achievements casting a shadow over her.

Graham notices the meticulously folded clothes on the coffee table.

GRAHAM
This isn't my fold.

Digging into his trousers pocket, Graham retrieves a phone.

GRAHAM
Claudia, hi, it's me... (listening) I'm alright... (listening) I've somehow ended up at the home of a former student, Helen... (listening) No, not the successful Helen Marlowe, some other Helen...
(to Helen)
Have I been kidnapped?

HELEN
No.

GRAHAM
She denies any kidnapping... (listening) Sleepwalking?... (listening) Perhaps a side effect of that new statin I'm on?... (listening) Yes, quite strange indeed... (listening) Could you come get me?
(to Helen)
What's the address, dear?

HELEN
47 Chesterfield Gardens.

GRAHAM
(to the phone)
47 Chesterfield Gardens.

BEN
(to Helen)
Are you sure you didn't kidnap us? 

Helen looks visibly sick. She goes to the bathroom.

Helen swings open a bathroom door to reveal STEPHANIE (30s), seated on the toilet. Helen's and Stephanie's eyes meet for a moment.

A flashback: Stephanie (10), adorned in a makeshift judge's robe.

STEPHANIE
Helen, how do you plead?

Three girls, acting as the court witnesses, point accusatory fingers at a young Helen (10), who sits apart, tears streaming down her face.

HELEN
(choking on her tears)
Not... not guilty.

Ben gently shuts the door and turns to see Helen's shocked face.

BEN
You look like you just saw a ghost. Was she the ghost?

HELEN
You are all ghosts.

Stephanie emerges. She sounds sweet and bubbly.

STEPHANIE
Oopsie daisy. That was quite a sighty. Caught me mid-action, eh?
(offers her hand to Ben with a grin)
I'm Steph. And you are?

BEN
Ben. Were you at XOYO last night?

STEPHANIE
I _was_ at XOYO. DJ Baba was oh-ama-zing. Got me excited. A lil too excited. I should have had a wet floor sign with me, you know what I mean?

Ben smiles - he likes her. Stephanie turns to a cold-faced Helen.

HELEN
Hi, Stephanie. You don't remember me, do you?

It takes a moment for Stephanie before recognition dawns on her face.

STEPHANIE
Helen? Blimey, it is you! Haven’t changed a bit, have you? It's been ages!

Stephanie briskly pulls a stiff Helen into an enthusiastic cheek kiss.

Back to the flashback of Stephanie and other girls playing a court. One of the girls Emily is in a make-shift witness stand.

EMILY
Helen told me she will share M&Ms with me. But before I knew it, she just ate the whole pack by herself. 

STEPAHNIE
(to Helen)
That's not nice sharing, is it?

The three girls nod in agreement.

Back to the present.

STEPHANIE
I remember you. Always scribbling in your little notebook.

Back to the flashback. Another girl, ABIGAIL, is now at the witness stand.

ABIGAIL
Josh is cool, Josh is neat,
Every day in school, my heart skips a beat.
His smile so wide, his eyes so bright,
Thinking of Josh fills my dreams at night.

As Abigail reads the other girls are giggling in a bullying way.

ABIGAIL
I wish I could tell him, but I'm too shy,
Whenever he's near, I just sigh.
Josh, if only you knew,
How much I adoor you.
(laughs)
Adoor you? Everyone knows Josh is my boyfriend now.

STEPHANIE
Not to mention guilty of bad spelling. That's three counts of guilt, young lady!

Back to the present.

Realisation occurs on Stephanie's face.

STEPHANIE
What am I doing here? 
(to Helen)
Did we bump into each other last night? I'm sorry, I was completely out of it.

BEN
Helen didn't kidnap you.

Helen dashes off into the kitchen. Ben and Stephanie follow her. Helen is looking for something in her cupboards. She opens and closes them. When she opens one of the cupboards, there is LINDA (40s) sitting in one of them, squeezed in. Helen jumps at the sight of her. There is a long moment of them, looking at each other. There are no flashbacks this time. 

Helen looks at Linda but unlike with others, she doesn't remember her.

LINDA
Have you seen my cat?

HELEN
Your cat? 

Suddenly a cat dashes in front of them. Helen starts sneezing uncontrollably.

Helen grabs a toolbox from the cupboard.

[They are watching a youtube video on how to unpick the lock and trying to do it but unsuccessfully]

CUT TO:

All five of them are sitting in the living room, waiting patiently.

HELEN
It's been an hour.

LINDA
Maybe they got caught in traffic.


[they ask Stephanie what does she do. She works with autistic children. Helen says she's autistic. they tell her she doesn't look like it]

BOSS
So, Ben, you're joining us online today?

BEN
I won't make it to the office. I got locked out.

BOSS
Okay, team. What is your update?

COLLEAGUE
Yesterday, I updated the UI with ____ and fed Brooks.

Helen reacts.

HELEN
What? What did he say?

BOSS
Ben? How is it going for you? [something about Helen]

BEN
Excuse me?

Helen snaps his laptop closed.

BEN
Was I your first?

HELEN
Mr. Harry, when you talked to your wife earlier, did she sound normal?

GRAHAM
She sounded like my wife.

Graham dials his phone.

[Claudia sounds normal. Helen tells Graham to ask Claudia something only she would know. She answers. Helen asks some facts, she sounds normal. Then suddenly she starts talking personal things about Helen]

STEPHANIE
Have you noticed something? 
(looking through the window)
The sun is in the same place it was an hour ago.

[suddenly police cars appear on the street but they just drive past]
