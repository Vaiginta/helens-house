Title: Helen's House - Extract

INT. XOYO CLUB - NIGHT #1#

The club pulsates with vibrant lights and thunderous music. BEN (30s), lively and uninhibited, navigates through the crowd, a drink in hand.

Ben's eyes lock with a YOUNG WOMAN (20s) in the crowd. They exchange smiles.

In a fast-paced montage, Ben and the Young Woman down shots, dance, share a pill, dance more and kiss. Eventually, Ben and the Young Woman make their way out of the club.

INT. HELEN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM #2#

Sunlight streams through the curtains. Ben's eyes flutter open. He feels an odd weight on his head. Reaching up, he touches the soft fur of a cat nestled atop his head. The cat meows loudly and leaps from his head, dashing across the room.

Ben turns, expecting to see the Young Woman, but instead finds HELEN (30s). Confusion spreads across his face.

Ben quietly gets out of bed, spots a pile of clothes, and pulls on a snug V-neck T-shirt, clearly meant for a woman. His hairy chest is awkwardly on display, peeking out from the neckline. He attempts to peel the shirt off, but it clings too tightly. 

Helen stirs in bed. Ben quickly gathers his belongings and heads for the door.

CUT TO:

INT. HELEN'S HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR #3#

Ben rushes down the stairs, making a beeline for the exit. He reaches the door, tugs at it, but it won't budge. Ben tries a few more times but to no avail. 

Ben goes to a window. Tries to open it. But like the door, the window resists his efforts, firmly stuck in place.

A sock flies past him.

Ben turns around and sees Helen standing there. She holds a laundry basket. Ben puts on a smile.

BEN
Last night was unforgettable. I mean, most of it is a blur, but in the best way possible. I wasn't trying to sneak out. 

Helen picks up a ball of socks from the laundry basket and tosses it at Ben, missing him by inches.

BEN
Okay, that's not true. Sneaking out was exactly what I was trying to do. I've got this thing at work, a meeting, and my bossâ€”-

Helen throws more socks at Ben, missing him each time.

HELEN
Take whatewer you like! The microwave, the TV, anything. Just so you know, the TV has a European plug but it's top of the range - 8K, 10-bit color and all. Don't rape me!

BEN
Hold on, what? Didn't we, you know, last night? I'm really sorry, I don't remember your name.

HELEN
Did we what last night?

Helen chucks more socks Ben's way.

BEN
We met at XOYO. Took Mandy. Ended up back here?

HELEN
XOYO?

BEN
XOYO, the club. DJ Baba was on the decks. He's huge in Germany. And you, your dance moves were...
(realizes)
It wasn't you, was it? It was a different girl. Petite, fiery red hair, absolutely stunning. She must be your flatmate?

HELEN
It's just me here. And Brooks.

BEN
Brooks, the cat.

HELEN
What cat? Brooks is a guinea pig. I'm allergic to cats.

BEN
Am I still tripping?

A brief flashback of Ben and Helen on a restaurant date flickers past. Recognition dawns on Helen's face.

HELEN
You're Ben, right? It's me, Helen.

Helen looks at Ben, expecting him to recognize her. Ben draws a blank.

BEN
You do look kind of familiar. Or you just remind me of someone else.

HELEN
Tapas bar, ten years ago? You nearly chocked on a meat skewer. I thought we had a really good time. Minus the almost chocking part.

Ben's expression remains blank.

HELEN
We went on a date. You never called.

BEN
I'm sorry about that.

Ben and Helen stand in an awkward silence.

BEN
I really should get going. Your door is jammed.
(realisation strikes him)
Did you kidnap me?

HELEN
Try lifting the handle while you pull it.

Ben lifts the handle, gives it a strong pull but it remains immovable.

BEN
Were you that upset I didn't call?

HELEN
I didn't kidnap you.

An ALARM suddenly goes off. They spin around and see GRAHAM (70s), in pyjamas, dozing on the couch. He stirs awake and reaches over to silence the phone alarm sitting on the coffee table.

Helen goes pale, upon seeing him.

A flashback reveals a younger Graham handing a paper marked with a 'C' to a pleading teenage Helen.

HELEN
Mr. Harry?

Graham appears disoriented.

GRAHAM
Where am I?

BEN
You're in Helen's house. 
(offers his hand)
I'm Ben.

GRAHAM
(shakes Ben's hand)
Graham. And who's Helen?

HELEN
I was in your class. Year eleven. This is too weird. 

BEN
(to Graham)
Were you at XOYO last night?

GRAHAM
I was at home with my wife. I've taught many Helens over the years. One of them was Helen Marlowe. Heard she's done quite well for herself. A PhD in Quantum Physics from Oxford. Top of the class. Entrepreneural, too. Her company attracted an investment from Bill Gates himself. Quite the brainbox, that one.

As Graham talks, Helen's face falls, clearly bothered by the mention of the other Helen's success.

Graham dials his phone.

GRAHAM
Claudia, hi, it's me... (listening) I'm alright... (listening) I've ended up at the home of a former student, Helen... (listening) Not the successful Helen Marlowe, some other Helen... 
(to Helen)
Am I kidnapped?

HELEN
No.

GRAHAM
She denies any kidnapping... (listening) Sleepwalking?... (listening) Perhaps a side effect of that new statin I'm on?... (listening) Yes, quite strange indeed...

BEN
(to Helen)
You sure you didn't accidentally kidnap us? Clicked on a dodgy pop-up ad, mistakenly placed a bid on us on eBay?
(seeing Helen's reaction)
No? Just wanted to make sure.

Helen appears unsteady. She heads towards the bathroom door.

Upon entering the bathroom, Helen discovers STEPHANIE (30s) on the toilet. Their eyes lock for a moment.

A flashback: Stephanie (10), dressed in a makeshift judge's robe.

STEPHANIE
Helen Marie Grace Miller, how do you plead?

Three girls, acting as the court witnesses, point accusatory fingers at a young Helen (10), who sits apart, tears streaming down her face.

HELEN
(through tears)
Not guilty.

Back to the present.

Helen exits the bathroom quickly. Ben notices Helen's shocked face.

BEN
You look like you've just seen a ghost. Was she the ghost?

HELEN
You're all ghosts.

Graham approaches them.

GRAHAM
I can't work out the door. I'd really like to head home now. That is, unless you've got a pressing algebra question for me.

Stephanie comes out, her demeanor light and cheerful.

STEPHANIE
Well, that was a bit embarrassing, wasn't it?
(extends a friendly hand to Ben)
I'm Steph. And you are?

GRAHAM
Graham.

Stephanie doesn't notice Graham.

BEN
(shakes Stephanie's hand)
Ben. Were you at XOYO last night?

STEPHANIE
Absolutely. I was there. DJ Baba had me bouncing off the walls. I wish I had a wet floor sign with me, you know what I mean?

GRAHAM
I'm afraid I don't follow.

Ben is charmed by Stephanie. She turns to Helen.

HELEN
(cold)
Hello, Stephanie. You don't remember me, do you?

Recognition slowly lights up Stephanie's face.

STEPHANIE
Helen? Blimey, it is you! You haven't changed one bit, have you? It's been ages!

Stephanie briskly pulls a rigid Helen into a warm hug and cheek kiss.

STEPHANIE
Did I run into you last night? Sorry, I was completely out of it.

BEN
Helen didn't kidnap you.

Helen rushes into the bathroom and vomits into the toilet. After rinsing her mouth at the sink, she opens a cabinet and finds LINDA (40s) sitting crammed inside. Helen jumps back in surprise.

LINDA
Where's Rusty?

HELEN
Rusty?

A cat dashes in front of Helen. She starts sneezing uncontrollably.

CUT TO:

Linda's at the door now, yanking and twisting the handle like there's no tomorrow.

STEPHANIE
Let me try.

Stephanie gently lifts the handle, and they hear a hopeful CLICK. 

STEPHANIE
(smiles at Ben)
Some doors don't like it rough.

But when it looks like she's about to get it open, the door stays stuck.

Meanwhile, Helen is on the phone.

HELEN
The address is 47 Chester Gardens... (listening) In 10 minutes? (listening) Perfect... (listening) No, the extra charge is fine... Thank you so much.

LINDA
(to Stephanie)
Mind stepping aside, love?

Stephanie steps back, and Linda charges at the door, giving it a massive kick. The effort sends her stumbling backward and she lands on her back.

HELEN
It's solid oak, please. The locksmith's on his way.

They can hear a muffled cat meow.

LINDA
Poor Rusty.

HELEN
I'm really sorry.

Linda shoots her a look of irritation.

BEN
For the record, I'm fatally allergic to cashews.

They all find seats on the couch, surrounded by a clutter of clothes and various items strewn across the living room. With a hint of embarrassment, Helen begins gathering the scattered belongings. She retrieves a T-shirt from beneath where Stephanie is seated.

STEPHANIE
(to Helen)
What are you up to these days? 

HELEN
I make websites.

STEPHANIE
Really? Sounds cool. What kind of websites?

Helen keeps on tidying.

HELEN
Boring websites. It's not cool. Why are you so surprised?

STEPHANIE
I'm impressed. You didn't do that well in school.

HELEN
Making websites isn't exactly rocket science. 

STEPHANIE
Oh right. Makes sense.

HELEN
(irritated)
I mean, I could do rocket science. I could have done rocket science. I could have done it all. I've got ADHD. 

GRAHAM
Heard Helen Marlowe is giving a Ted Talk on using AI to solve the climate crisis.

Helen looks pained by another mention of Helen Marlowe.

LINDA
(to Helen)
You hardly come off as hyper.

STEPHANIE
I'm pretty sure I have ADHD.

Flashback: HELEN (10) sits alone in the canteen, lost in thought as she eats her lunch. Stephanie sneaks up behind her and says "boo" into Helen's ear. Startled, Helen jumps up, causing her glass of juice to spill onto her lap. Stephanie and the other girls burst into laughter.

Back to the present.

LINDA
(to Stephanie)
I would say you look more hyper than her.

STEPHANIE
There's this ADHD TikToker I follow. She did a skit about forgetting names as soon as she hears them - laughed my head off. So relatable.

BEN
I'm terrible with names, especially girls' names. Think I've got ADHD too?

GRAHAM
It seems disorders have become quite fashionable, haven't they? Every student now comes with a label - attention deficit, dyslexia, dyscalculia. Back in the day we just called it bad at Maths.

A flashback. Helen (15) stands in front of a younger Graham in the classroom.

HELEN
I made a stupid mistake, please. I get the disk method. I do!

Back to the present.

LINDA
Speaking of which, no one remembers how we got here.

BEN
Perhaps it's an elaborate prank on Helen that we all unknowingly signed up for? You know, by blindly agreeing to the terms and conditions.

Helen's phone rings. She answers it.

MAN (V.O.)
Hiya, John here from KeyMaster Services. I can't seem to find your place.

HELEN
Okay, erm... can you describe what's around you?

MAN (V.O.)
Not much, really. Just empty fields. I can see a cow.

HELEN
A cow?

Stephanie peers out the window.

STEPHANIE
They're here!

Outside, a car with the locksmith service's logo is parked. A LOCKSMITH, donning the company's T-shirt, stands by the car, phone in hand.

Helen glances through the window.

HELEN
Yes, I can see you! You're parked right in front of my house.

LOCKSMITH (V.O.)
What do you mean I'm right in front of it? I'm telling you - it's just an open land here.

HELEN
You're wearing a blue T-shirt.

The Locksmith glances down at his blue T-shirt.

LOCKSMITH (V.O.)
You're right. I _am_ wearing a blue T-shirt but do you see the guinea pig in my pocket?

Helen sees a guinea pig peeking out from the Locksmith's pocket.

HELEN
Brooks?

LOCKSMITH (V.O.)
Yes, Brooks but we both know you call it Ben. You can't forget that night, can you?

Helen ends the call and flings the phone away, as though it was tainted.
