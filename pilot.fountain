Title: Helen's House - Pilot
Author: Vaiga Perkauskaite

INT. XOYO CLUB (LONDON) - NIGHT #1#

The club pulsates with vibrant lights and thunderous music. 

BEN (30s) navigates through the crowd, a drink in hand. Ben's eyes lock with a YOUNG WOMAN (20s).

In a fast-paced montage, Ben and the Young Woman down shots, dance, share a pill, dance more and kiss.

INT. HELEN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM #2#

Morning light filters in as Ben wakes. Ben reaches up and touches a GINGER CAT nestled atop his head. It meows and scampers off.

Ben turns, expecting to see the Young Woman, but instead finds HELEN (30s). Confusion spreads across his face.

Helen stirs in bed. Ben quickly gathers his belongings and heads for the door.

CUT TO:

INT. HELEN'S HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR #3#

Ben makes a beeline for the exit. He pulls at the door, but it won't budge. After several attempts, he gives up.

Ben moves to a window, trying to open it, but it's just as immovable.

Suddenly, a sock whizzes past him.

Ben spins around and sees Helen with a laundry basket. He forces a smile.

BEN
Last night was unforgettable. I mean, most of it is a blur but in the best way possible. I wasn't trying to sneak out.

Helen picks up a balled up sock from the laundry basket and tosses it at Ben. It hits him squarely, but the impact is comically underwhelming.

BEN
Okay, that's not true. Sneaking out was exactly what I was trying to do. I've got this thing at work, a meeting, and my boss—-

Helen throws more socks at Ben.

BEN
That's not entirely true either. I don't have a boss. Or a job. What I do have is a bad case of claustrophobia that's flaring up quite inconveniently.

HELEN
Take whatewer you like! The microwave, the TV, anything. Don't rape me!

BEN
Hold on, what? Didn't we, you know, last night? I'm really sorry, I don't remember your name.

HELEN
Did we what last night?

Helen chucks more socks Ben's way.

BEN
We met at XOYO. Took Mandy. Ended up back here?

HELEN
XOYO?

BEN
DJ Baba was on the decks. He's huge in Germany. It wasn't you, was it? It was a different lady. Petite, fiery red hair, absolutely stunning. She must be your flatmate?

HELEN
It's just me here.

BEN
Well, and the cat.

HELEN
What cat?

BEN
Your cat, I assume.

HELEN
I don't have a cat. I'm allergic to cats.

BEN
When I woke up there was a... am I still tripping?

A brief flashback of Ben and Helen on a restaurant date flickers past. Recognition dawns on Helen's face.

HELEN
You're Ben, right? It's me, Helen.

Helen looks at Ben, expecting him to recognize her. Ben draws a blank.

BEN
You look familiar. Or you remind me of someone else.

HELEN
Tapas bar, ten years ago? You nearly chocked on a meat skewer. I thought we had a really good time. Minus the almost chocking part.

Ben's expression remains blank.

HELEN
We went on a date. You never called.

BEN
I'm sorry about that.

Ben and Helen stand in an awkward silence.

BEN
Your door is jammed.
(realisation strikes him)
Did you kidnap me?

HELEN
Give it a firm pull.

Ben gives the door a strong pull but it remains immovable.

BEN
Were you that upset I didn't call?

HELEN
I didn't kidnap you.

An ALARM goes off. They spin around and see GRAHAM (70s), in pyjamas, dozing on the couch. He stirs awake and reaches over to silence the phone alarm sitting on the coffee table.

Helen goes pale, upon seeing him.

A flashback reveals a younger Graham handing a paper marked with a 'C' to a pleading teenage Helen.

HELEN
Mr. Harry?

Graham appears disoriented.

GRAHAM
Where am I?

BEN
You're in Helen's house. 
(offers his hand)
I'm Ben.

GRAHAM
(shakes Ben's hand)
Graham. And who's Helen?

HELEN
I was in your class. Year eleven. This is too weird. 

BEN
(to Graham)
Were you at XOYO last night?

GRAHAM
I was at home with my wife. I've taught many Helens over the years. One of them was Helen Marlowe. Heard she's done quite well for herself. A PhD in Quantum Physics from Oxford. Entrepreneural, too. Her company attracted an investment from Bill Gates himself. Quite the brainbox, that one.

As Graham talks, Helen's face falls, clearly bothered by the mention of the other Helen's success.

Graham dials his phone.

GRAHAM
Hi Claudia, it’s me... (listening) I'm alright... (listening) I've ended up at the house of a former student named Helen. Not Helen Marlowe, the successful one. Some other Helen. 
(pauses, then to Helen)
Am I kidnapped?

HELEN
No.

GRAHAM
She denies any kidnapping... (listening) Sleepwalking?... (listening) Perhaps a side effect of that new statin I'm on?

Graham's voice fades as we focus on Ben and Helen.

BEN
(to Helen)
You sure you didn't accidentally kidnap us? Clicked on a dodgy pop-up ad, mistakenly placed a bid on us on eBay?
(seeing Helen's reaction)
Just wanted to make sure.

Helen appears unsteady. She heads towards the bathroom door.

Upon entering the bathroom, Helen discovers STEPHANIE (30s) posing in front of the mirror, taking a BATHROOM SELFIE with her lips pouted and curving her bum.

A flashback: Stephanie (10), dressed in a makeshift judge's robe.

STEPHANIE
Helen Marie Grace Miller, how do you plead?

Three girls, acting as the court witnesses, point accusatory fingers at a young Helen (10), who sits apart, tears streaming down her face.

HELEN
(through tears)
Not guilty.

Back to the present.

Stephanie notices Helen staring at her. Helen exits the bathroom quickly.

BEN
You look like you've just seen a ghost. Was she the ghost?

HELEN
You're all ghosts.

Graham approaches them.

GRAHAM
I can't work out the door. I'd really like to head home now. That is, unless you've got a pressing algebra question for me.

Stephanie comes out, her demeanor light and cheerful.

STEPHANIE
(to Ben)
I'm Steph. And you are?

GRAHAM
Graham.

Stephanie doesn't notice Graham.

BEN
Ben. Were you at XOYO last night?

STEPHANIE
Absolutely. I was there. DJ Baba had me bouncing off the walls. I wish I had a wet floor sign with me, you know what I mean?

GRAHAM
I'm afraid I don't follow.

Ben is charmed by Stephanie. She turns to Helen.

HELEN
(cold)
Hello, Stephanie. You don't remember me, do you?

Recognition slowly lights up Stephanie's face.

STEPHANIE
Helen? It's been ages! You haven't changed one bit, have you? 

Stephanie briskly pulls a rigid Helen into a warm hug and cheek kiss.

STEPHANIE
Did I run into you last night? Sorry, I was completely out of it.

BEN
Helen didn't kidnap you.

Helen rushes into the bathroom and vomits into the toilet. After rinsing her mouth at the sink, she opens a cabinet and finds LINDA (40s) sitting crammed inside. Helen jumps back in surprise.

LINDA
Where's Rusty?

HELEN
Rusty?

The GINGER CAT dashes in front of Helen. She starts sneezing uncontrollably.

CUT TO:

Linda's at the door now, yanking and twisting the handle like there's no tomorrow.

STEPHANIE
(to Linda)
Lisa?

LINDA
My name's Linda.

STEPHANIE
Sorry, Linda. 
(re: the door)
Can I try?

Stephanie gently lifts the handle, and they hear a hopeful CLICK. 

STEPHANIE
(smiles at Ben)
Some doors don't like it rough.

When it looks like she's about to get it open, the door stays stuck.

Helen is on the phone.

HELEN
The address is 47 Greenwich Grove. You can call me back on 07932...

Helen's voice fades and we focus on Linda, Stephanie and Ben.

LINDA
(to Stephanie)
Mind stepping aside, love?

Stephanie steps back, and Linda charges at the door, giving it a massive kick. The effort sends her stumbling backward and she lands on her back.

HELEN
Called five locksmiths. Couldn't get through. Must be lunchtime.

A muffled CAT MEOW is heard.

LINDA
Poor Rusty.

HELEN
I'm really sorry. My allergy is pretty bad.

Linda shoots her a look of irritation.

BEN
For the record, I'm fatally allergic to cashews.

They all find seats on the couch, surrounded by a clutter of clothes and various items strewn across the living room. With a hint of embarrassment, Helen begins gathering the scattered belongings. She retrieves a T-shirt from beneath where Stephanie is seated.

Stephanie is on her phone, editing her BATHROOM SELFIE on Instagram.

STEPHANIE
(to Helen)
What are you up to these days? 

HELEN
I make websites.

STEPHANIE
Really? Sounds cool. What kind of websites?

Helen keeps on tidying.

HELEN
Boring websites. It's not cool. Why are you so surprised?

STEPHANIE
I'm impressed. You weren't exactly top of your class.

HELEN
Building websites isn't rocket science. 

STEPHANIE
Right. Makes sense.

HELEN
(irritated)
I mean, I could do rocket science.

GRAHAM
Heard Helen Marlowe is giving a Ted Talk on using AI to solve the climate crisis.

Helen looks pained by another mention of Helen Marlowe.

HELEN
I struggled in school because of ADHD.

Helen glimpses at Graham but he doesn't react.

LINDA
(to Helen)
You hardly come off as hyper.

STEPHANIE
I'm pretty sure I have ADHD.

HELEN
You?

Flashback: HELEN (10) sits alone in a playground, daydreaming. Stephanie and the three other girls walk up to her. Stephanie signals to AMBER (10) and she places a snail on Helen's hand. Helen doesn’t notice at first. The girls giggle. Helen then sees the snail and jumps up, shaking her hand.

Back to the present.

LINDA
(to Stephanie)
I'd say you look more hyper than her.

STEPHANIE
I follow this ADHD TikToker. She did a skit about forgetting people's names as soon as she hears them. Laughed my head off. So relatable.

BEN
I'm terrible with names, especially girls' names. Think I've got ADHD too?

GRAHAM
It seems disorders have become quite fashionable, haven't they? Every student now comes with a label - attention deficit, dyslexia, dyscalculia. Back in the day we just called it bad at Maths.

A flashback. Helen (15) stands in front of a younger Graham in the classroom.

HELEN
I made a stupid mistake, please. I get the disk method. I do!

Back to the present.

LINDA
Speaking of which, no one remembers how we ended up here.

STEPHANIE
(to Linda)
What's the last thing you remember?

LINDA
I was on a night shift at the council. Took a call. A mum moaning about the neighbour's bash keeping her baby awake. Not my baby, not my problem.

Linda glances around, hoping for understanding from the others, but finds none.

LINDA (CONT'D)
Anyway, dosed off after the call. To be honest, probably drifted off mid-call. Woke up here, on the bathroom floor.

This makes Helen think.

HELEN
We spoke once. I called for the council tax refund. You called me stupid. You said I rang the wrong council.

LINDA
It is stupid to ring the wrong council.

HELEN
It wasn't the wrong council. I never got my refund.

BEN
Perhaps this is an elaborate prank on Helen that we all unknowingly signed up for? You know, by blindly agreeing to the terms and conditions.

Helen's phone rings. She answers it.

LOCKSMITH (V.O.)
Hiya, John here from KeyMaster Services. I received your voicemail.

HELEN
(sighs in relief)
Oh thank God.

LOCKSMITH (V.O.)
Can you confirm the address for me?

HELEN
47 Greenwich Grove.

LOCKSMITH (V.O.)
Did you say there is a fire at your house?

HELEN
No, I didn’t say there's a fire.

LOCKSMITH (V.O.)
There is a dog locked inside?

HELEN
No dog. No fire.

LOCKSMITH (V.O.)
You should call the fire department.

HELEN
I'm locked in the house with a bunch of strangers. They're not exactly strangers but I didn't invite them.

LOCKSMITH (V.O.)
I can't help you, love. You need to call 999.

Locksmith hangs up. Helen stares at her phone, confused.

STEPHANIE
(looks at her phone, mortified)
Guys, this is super fucking weird.

Everyone huddles around to look at Stephanie's phone. It displays the BATHROOM SELFIE she took earlier, now posted on Instagram. Except, the background is different — instead of the bathroom, she is outside a house, standing next to a GEEKY GUY (30) with his arm wrapped around her. Her hand is proudly showing off an engagement ring.

BEN
Bummer.

STEPHANIE
Who is this guy?

LINDA
Your fiancé?

STEPHANIE
(disgusted)
He is not my fiancé. I've never seen him in my life!

HELEN
(looking at the phone)
His name is Ed.

STEPHANIE
I don't know any Eds!

GRAHAM
Ed Rickman was an art history teacher, but he passed away last year, so it certainly can't be him.

HELEN
Click on his profile.

CLOSE ON Stephanie's phone. She clicks on a tagged account, revealing the profile of the GEEKY GUY named ED. All of his photos feature Stephanie. In most of them, they’re smooching passionately.

STEPHANIE
Ew...

Stephanie's phone flashes with an incoming video call. On the screen is Amber (30). A brief flashback reveals it's the girl who placed the snail on Helen's arm.

STEPHANIE
Oh my God, Amb! Did you see the weird shit on my Instagram?

AMBER
Well, look who's all engaged! You two are adorable. When's the big day?

STEPHANIE
There's no big day.

AMBER
The 27th of August? Wow, you are in a hurry. What's the rush?

STEPHANIE
Can you hear what I'm saying?

AMBER
Shut up! Twins?

STEPHANIE
What twins? 

Stephanie turns her phone towards Helen.

STEPHANIE
Do you remember Helen?

HELEN
(cold)
Hi, Amber.

AMBER
(waves at the screen)
Oh hi, Ed.

Stephanie notices her own thumbnail view in the corner of the call screen - Helen has been replaced with Ed who is kissing her neck.

AMBER
Awww, you two! Get a room already.

Stephanie hangs up the phone, horrified.

STEPHANIE
This is freaking me out. What's going on?

HELEN
When I talked to the locksmith, he kept asking about a fire. Our communications are getting weirdly distorted.

LINDA
So, we can't call for help.

HELEN
(to Graham)
You spoke to your wife earlier. Did she understand you okay?

GRAHAM
She was pleased about the diamond tiara I bought her.

LINDA
*Did* you buy her a diamond tiara?

GRAHAM
No. I have no clue where she got that from.

BEN
I got a weird text too, from a girl I met last month.

LINDA
What did it say?

BEN
She called me a massive prick. Which isn't fair. I pale in comparison with other pricks.

Suddenly, the wail of a fire engine's siren cuts through the air. The room is quickly engulfed in the glow of red flashing lights.

Through the window, they see a fire truck pulling up outside. A team of firefighters jumps out.

The group rushes to the window.

Two firefighters begin dousing the house with water, streams cascading down the window.

The group peers out - from the outside, the house indeed looks like it's burning.

BEN
Strange we never noticed.

Through the window, they see FIREFIGHTER 1 approaching the front door. With an axe in hand, he swings forcefully.

The group rushes to the door, only to find it untouched. Puzzled, they return to the window and see Firefighter 1 splintering the door open. Smoke billows out as he enters.

They sprint back to the actual door which is still intact.

HELEN
We just saw him go inside!

The group run back to the window. 

FIREFIGHTER 2 grabs a loudspeaker.

FIREFIGHTER 2
(into speaker)
Can you locate the canine? Repeat, can you locate the canine?

The voice of Firefighter 1 echoes in the house as if coming from an invisible speaker.

FIREFIGHTER 1
Negative on the canine.

The group looks around the room, confused, trying to locate the source of the voice.

FIREFIGHTER 1
But I have eyes on a feline, ginger coat, appears healthy.

A cat's meow echoes in the room.

LINDA
Rusty?

Linda runs to the bathroom, opens the door, and searches every spot but finds no sign of Rusty.

LINDA
Rusty's gone!

She runs back to the window. Firefighter 1 emerges, carrying Rusty, wrapped in a blanket. Linda bangs on the window.

LINDA
That's my Rusty, you pricks!

Linda throws a chair at the window. Instead of breaking, it bounces back and hits Ben, knocking him over.

Helen helps Ben up.

HELEN
You okay?

BEN
I lost a brain cell, but I doubt anyone will notice.

Helen lets out a chuckle, then composes herself.

Through the window they see the firefighters jumping back into the truck and driving off.

Linda grabs a coffee table and hurls it at the window.

Suddenly, like flipping a channel, the scene outside transforms into a seaside landscape, complete with squawking seagulls.

STEPHANIE
Where are we?

BEN
Brighton.
(points to the window)
Look, there's the pier.

As they observe, a group of tourists walks by, pausing in front of the windows to snap photos.

HELEN
Why and how is my house in Brighton now?

STEPHANIE
(trying to interact with the tourists)
Hi?

The tourists quickly move on.

Linda examines the window more closely and finds a hidden switch. She flips it, and the view changes to an unsettling underwater scene teeming with shadowy sea creatures.

STEPHANIE
Ew, that's creepy.

Linda quickly changes the view; next, a sun-drenched tropical beach materializes.

LINDA
How about this one? Or...

She flips the switch again, transporting them to the peak of a mountain.

LINDA
Or...

Switching once more, the surroundings shift to space, where Brooks appears floating in a spacesuit.

HELEN
Leave this on —-

Linda switches it back to the original view.

HELEN
Does anyone have a logical explanation for any of this?

Ben checks his phone.

BEN
The most logical explanation is that we're in the English Channel.

HELEN
How is that a logical explanation?

Ben shows his phone to the group, pointing to a blue dot right in the middle of the English Channel.

GRAHAM
I've heard Helen Marlowe is currently swimming the English Channel.

HELEN
Would you stop bringing up Helen Marlowe? I could have been Helen Marlowe. If I'd had the chance.

BEN
It seems to check out. My Fitbit says I've swum 10 miles.

HELEN
Are you telling me — last night, after an all-nighter doing drugs with some girl, you somehow ended up swimming the English Channel?

BEN
That would certainly rank as one of the most impressive feats in human history.

LINDA
Where are your tools, Helen?

Helen stares at Linda, distracted.

LINDA
Hammer, chainsaw, a massive fork, something.

HELEN
I have some things in the closet.

Helen gestures towards the door under the stairs. Linda walks up to the closet.

STEPHANIE
Maybe there's a reason we're all here together.

HELEN
There's a reason! You've all been dicks to me.

STEPHANIE
I've never been a dick to anyone.

Instead of replying, Helen shakes her head.
