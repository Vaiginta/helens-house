Title: Helen's House - Pilot

INT. XOYO CLUB - NIGHT #1#

The club pulsates with vibrant lights and thunderous music. 

BEN (30s) navigates through the crowd, a drink in hand. Ben's eyes lock with a YOUNG WOMAN (20s).

In a fast-paced montage, Ben and the Young Woman down shots, dance, share a pill, dance more and kiss.

INT. HELEN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM #2#

Morning light filters in as Ben wakes. A cat sits nestled atop his head. It meows and scampers off. 

Ben turns, expecting to see the Young Woman, but instead finds HELEN (30s). Confusion spreads across his face.

Helen stirs in bed. Ben quickly gathers his belongings and heads for the door.

CUT TO:

INT. HELEN'S HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR #3#

Ben rushes down the stairs, making a beeline for the exit. He reaches the door, tugs at it, but it won't budge. Ben tries a few more times but to no avail. 

Ben goes to a window. Tries to open it. But like the door, the window resists his efforts, firmly stuck in place.

A sock flies past him.

Ben turns around and sees Helen standing there. She holds a laundry basket. Ben puts on a smile.

BEN
Last night was unforgettable. I mean, most of it is a blur, but in the best way possible. I wasn't trying to sneak out.

Helen picks up a ball of socks from the laundry basket and tosses it at Ben, missing him by inches.

BEN
Okay, that's not true. Sneaking out was exactly what I was trying to do. I've got this thing at work, a meeting, and my boss—-

Helen throws more socks at Ben, missing him each time.

HELEN
Take whatewer you like! The microwave, the TV, anything. Just so you know, the TV has a European plug but it's top of the range - 8K, 10-bit color and all. Don't rape me!

BEN
Hold on, what? Didn't we, you know, last night? I'm really sorry, I don't remember your name.

HELEN
Did we what last night?

Helen chucks more socks Ben's way.

BEN
We met at XOYO. Took Mandy. Ended up back here?

HELEN
XOYO?

BEN
XOYO, the club. DJ Baba was on the decks. He's huge in Germany. And you, your dance moves were...
(realizes)
It wasn't you, was it? It was a different girl. Petite, fiery red hair, absolutely stunning. She must be your flatmate?

HELEN
It's just me here. And Brooks.

BEN
Brooks, the cat.

HELEN
What cat? Brooks is a guinea pig. I'm allergic to cats.

BEN
Am I still tripping?

A brief flashback of Ben and Helen on a restaurant date flickers past. Recognition dawns on Helen's face.

HELEN
You're Ben, right? It's me, Helen.

Helen looks at Ben, expecting him to recognize her. Ben draws a blank.

BEN
You look kind of familiar. Or you remind me of someone else.

HELEN
Tapas bar, ten years ago? You nearly chocked on a meat skewer. I thought we had a really good time. Minus the almost chocking part.

Ben's expression remains blank.

HELEN
We went on a date. You never called.

BEN
I'm sorry about that.

Ben and Helen stand in an awkward silence.

BEN
I really should get going. Your door is jammed.
(realisation strikes him)
Did you kidnap me?

HELEN
Give it a firm pull.

Ben gives the door a strong pull but it remains immovable.

BEN
Were you that upset I didn't call?

HELEN
I didn't kidnap you.

An ALARM suddenly goes off. They spin around and see GRAHAM (70s), in pyjamas, dozing on the couch. He stirs awake and reaches over to silence the phone alarm sitting on the coffee table.

Helen goes pale, upon seeing him.

A flashback reveals a younger Graham handing a paper marked with a 'C' to a pleading teenage Helen.

HELEN
Mr. Harry?

Graham appears disoriented.

GRAHAM
Where am I?

BEN
You're in Helen's house. 
(offers his hand)
I'm Ben.

GRAHAM
(shakes Ben's hand)
Graham. And who's Helen?

HELEN
I was in your class. Year eleven. This is too weird. 

BEN
(to Graham)
Were you at XOYO last night?

GRAHAM
I was at home with my wife. I've taught many Helens over the years. One of them was Helen Marlowe. Heard she's done quite well for herself. A PhD in Quantum Physics from Oxford. Top of the class. Entrepreneural, too. Her company attracted an investment from Bill Gates himself. Quite the brainbox, that one.

As Graham talks, Helen's face falls, clearly bothered by the mention of the other Helen's success.

Graham dials his phone.

GRAHAM
Claudia, hi, it's me... (listening) I'm alright... (listening) I've ended up at the home of a former student, Helen... (listening) Not the successful Helen Marlowe, some other Helen... 
(to Helen)
Am I kidnapped?

HELEN
No.

GRAHAM
She denies any kidnapping... (listening) Sleepwalking?... (listening) Perhaps a side effect of that new statin I'm on?... (listening) Yes, quite strange indeed...

BEN
(to Helen)
You sure you didn't accidentally kidnap us? Clicked on a dodgy pop-up ad, mistakenly placed a bid on us on eBay?
(seeing Helen's reaction)
No? Just wanted to make sure.

Helen appears unsteady. She heads towards the bathroom door.

Upon entering the bathroom, Helen discovers STEPHANIE (30s) posing in front of the mirror, taking a selfie with her lips pouted and curving her bum.

A flashback: Stephanie (10), dressed in a makeshift judge's robe.

STEPHANIE
Helen Marie Grace Miller, how do you plead?

Three girls, acting as the court witnesses, point accusatory fingers at a young Helen (10), who sits apart, tears streaming down her face.

HELEN
(through tears)
Not guilty.

Back to the present.

Stephanie notices Helen staring at her.

Helen exits the bathroom quickly. Ben notices Helen's shocked face.

BEN
You look like you've just seen a ghost. Was she the ghost?

HELEN
You're all ghosts.

Graham approaches them.

GRAHAM
I can't work out the door. I'd really like to head home now. That is, unless you've got a pressing algebra question for me.

Stephanie comes out, her demeanor light and cheerful.

STEPHANIE
(extends a friendly hand to Ben)
I'm Steph. And you are?

GRAHAM
Graham.

Stephanie doesn't notice Graham.

BEN
(shakes Stephanie's hand)
Ben. Were you at XOYO last night?

STEPHANIE
Absolutely. I was there. DJ Baba had me bouncing off the walls. I wish I had a wet floor sign with me, you know what I mean?

GRAHAM
I'm afraid I don't follow.

Ben is charmed by Stephanie. She turns to Helen.

HELEN
(cold)
Hello, Stephanie. You don't remember me, do you?

Recognition slowly lights up Stephanie's face.

STEPHANIE
Helen? Blimey, it is you! You haven't changed one bit, have you? It's been ages!

Stephanie briskly pulls a rigid Helen into a warm hug and cheek kiss.

STEPHANIE
Did I run into you last night? Sorry, I was completely out of it.

BEN
Helen didn't kidnap you.

Helen rushes into the bathroom and vomits into the toilet. After rinsing her mouth at the sink, she opens a cabinet and finds LINDA (40s) sitting crammed inside. Helen jumps back in surprise.

LINDA
Where's Rusty?

HELEN
Rusty?

A cat dashes in front of Helen. She starts sneezing uncontrollably.

CUT TO:

Linda's at the door now, yanking and twisting the handle like there's no tomorrow.

STEPHANIE
(to Linda)
Lisa?

LINDA
My name's Linda.

STEPHANIE
Sorry, Linda. Mind if I try?

Stephanie gently lifts the handle, and they hear a hopeful CLICK. 

STEPHANIE
(smiles at Ben)
Some doors don't like it rough.

But when it looks like she's about to get it open, the door stays stuck.

Helen is on the phone.

HELEN
The address is 47 Chester Gardens... (listening) In 10 minutes? (listening) Perfect... (listening) No, the extra charge is fine... Thank you so much.

LINDA
(to Stephanie)
Mind stepping aside, love?

Stephanie steps back, and Linda charges at the door, giving it a massive kick. The effort sends her stumbling backward and she lands on her back.

HELEN
It's solid oak, please. The locksmith's on his way.

They can hear a muffled cat meow.

LINDA
Poor Rusty.

HELEN
I'm really sorry. My allergy is pretty bad.

Linda shoots her a look of irritation.

BEN
For the record, I'm fatally allergic to cashews.

They all find seats on the couch, surrounded by a clutter of clothes and various items strewn across the living room. With a hint of embarrassment, Helen begins gathering the scattered belongings. She retrieves a T-shirt from beneath where Stephanie is seated.

STEPHANIE
(to Helen)
What are you up to these days? 

HELEN
I make websites.

STEPHANIE
Really? Sounds cool. What kind of websites?

Helen keeps on tidying.

HELEN
Boring websites. It's not cool. Why are you so surprised?

STEPHANIE
I'm impressed. You didn't do that well in school.

HELEN
Making websites isn't exactly rocket science. 

STEPHANIE
Oh right. Makes sense.

HELEN
(irritated)
I mean, I could do rocket science.

GRAHAM
Heard Helen Marlowe is giving a Ted Talk on using AI to solve the climate crisis.

Helen looks pained by another mention of Helen Marlowe.

HELEN
I've got ADHD.

LINDA
You hardly come off as hyper.

STEPHANIE
I've got ADHD too.

HELEN
(increduluous)
Really, you?

Flashback: HELEN (10) sits alone in the canteen, lost in thought as she eats her lunch. Stephanie sneaks up behind her and says "boo" into Helen's ear. Startled, Helen jumps up, causing her glass of juice to spill onto her lap. Stephanie and the other girls burst into laughter.

Back to the present.

LINDA
(to Stephanie)
I would say you look more hyper than her.

STEPHANIE
I've been making lots of ADHD content lately.

HELEN
Is that your job?

STEPHANIE
I did a skit about forgetting people's names as soon as I hear them. It really struck a chord with people. Got 2 million hits.

BEN
I'm terrible with names, especially girls' names. Think I've got ADHD too?

GRAHAM
It seems disorders have become quite fashionable, haven't they? Every student now comes with a label - attention deficit, dyslexia, dyscalculia. Back in the day we just called it bad at Maths.

A flashback. Helen (15) stands in front of a younger Graham in the classroom.

HELEN
I made a stupid mistake, please. I get the disk method. I do!

Back to the present.

LINDA
Speaking of which, no one remembers how we ended up here.

STEPHANIE
I'm trying to piece it together. The last thing I remember is... 
(surprised by her own memory)
...a tractor.

BEN
A tractor?

LINDA
Were you inside or outside the tractor?

Stephanie concentrates.

STEPHANIE
Inside the tractor, definitely inside the tractor. But why? What do you remember, Linda?

LINDA
I was on a night shift at the council. Took a call - a mum moaning about the neighbour's bash keeping her baby awake. Not my baby, not my problem, right? 

Linda glances around, hoping for sympathy from the others, but finds none.

LINDA (CONT'D)
Anyway, dosed off after the call. To be honest, probably drifted off mid-call. Next thing I know, I'm lying on the bathroom floor here.

This makes Helen think.

HELEN
(to Linda)
We spoke once. I called for the council tax refund.

LINDA
(unimpressed)
Okay.

HELEN
You called me stupid. You said I rang the wrong council.

LINDA
It is stupid to ring the wrong council.

HELEN
It wasn't the wrong council. I never got the refund.

BEN
Perhaps this is an elaborate prank on Helen that we all unknowingly signed up for? You know, by blindly agreeing to the terms and conditions.

Helen's phone rings. She answers it.

MAN (V.O.)
Hiya, John here from KeyMaster Services. Having a bit of trouble finding your place.

HELEN
What can you see around you?

MAN (V.O.)
Not a whole lot, just fields. I can see a cow.

HELEN
A cow?

Stephanie peers out the window.

STEPHANIE
They're here!

Outside, a car with the locksmith service's logo is parked. A LOCKSMITH, donning the company's T-shirt, stands by the car, phone in hand.

Helen glances through the window.

HELEN
I see you! You're parked right in front of my house.

LOCKSMITH (V.O.)
What do you mean - right in front? I'm telling you - it's just an open land here.

HELEN
You're wearing a blue T-shirt.

The Locksmith glances down at his blue T-shirt.

LOCKSMITH (V.O.)
You're right. I _am_ wearing a blue T-shirt but do you see the guinea pig in my pocket?

Helen sees a guinea pig peeking out from the Locksmith's pocket.

HELEN
Brooks?

LOCKSMITH (V.O.)
We both know you call it Ben.

Helen hastily ends the call, tossing her phone aside as if it were contaminated. Locksmith's voice continues to resonate throughout the room, as though broadcasted by an invisible loudspeaker.

LOCKSMITH (V.O.)  
Let go of the Ben saga, will you? Dwelling on every bird he's seen since you two went out. Wondering endlessly — what does he see in them? What was supposedly lacking in you? Why did Amber Smith, of all people, manage to snag him for a year?"

Ben looks at Helen, curious, somewhat flattered by this.

Helen's face flushes a deep shade of red as Locksmith speaks. She scurries about in confusion, trying to locate the source of this disembodied voice.

LOCKSMITH (V.O.)
You joked about 'Schrodinger's cat' just as Ben nearly choked and think that's why he never called? Truth is, Ben thinks 'Schrodinger' is just a fancy cat breed.

BEN
Is it not?

LOCKSMITH (V.O.)
If you lot want out of here...

He stops speaking, leaving a cliffhanger hanging in the air.

LINDA
We do!

LOCKSMITH (V.O.)
Your clue's on Helen's todo list.

Following this, the line goes dead with the distinct beep of a call ending.

They see through the window - Locksmith gets in the car and drives away.

Ben turns to Helen, who is frozen with embarrassment.

BEN
I don't mind being stalked.

Helen doesn't even look his way.
