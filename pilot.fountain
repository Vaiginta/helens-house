INT. XOYO CLUB - NIGHT #1#

The club pulsates with vibrant lights and thunderous music. BEN (30s), lively and uninhibited, navigates through the crowd, a drink in hand.

Ben's eyes lock with a YOUNG WOMAN (20s) in the crowd. They exchange smiles.

In a fast-paced montage, Ben and the Young Woman down shots, dance, share a pill, dance more and kiss. Eventually, Ben and the Young Woman make their way out of the club.

INT. HELEN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM #2#

Sunlight streams through the curtains. Ben's eyes flutter open. He feels an odd weight on his head. Reaching up, he touches the soft fur of a cat nestled atop his head. The cat meows loudly and leaps from his head, dashing across the room.

Ben turns, expecting to see the Young Woman, but instead finds HELEN (30s). Confusion spreads across his face.

Ben quietly gets out of bed, spots a pile of clothes, and pulls on a snug V-neck T-shirt, clearly meant for a woman. His hairy chest is awkwardly on display, peeking out from the neckline. He attempts to peel the shirt off, but it clings too tightly. 

Helen stirs in the bed. Ben quickly gathers his belongings and heads for the door.

CUT TO:

INT. HELEN'S HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR #3#

Ben rushes down the stairs, heading straight for the exit. He reaches the door, tugs at it, but it won't budge. Ben tries a few more times but to no avail. 

Ben goes to a window. Tries to open it. But like the door, the window resists his efforts, firmly stuck in place.

Suddenly, a sock flies past him.

Ben turns around and sees Helen standing there. She holds a laundry basket. Ben puts on a smile.

BEN
Last night was quite something, unforgettable. I mean, most of it is a blur, but in the best way possible. I wasn't trying to sneak out. 

Helen picks up a ball of socks from the laundry basket and tosses it at Ben, missing him by inches.

BEN (CONT'D)
Okay, that's not true. Sneaking out was exactly what I was trying to do. I've got this thing at work, a meeting, and my boss—-

Helen throws more socks at Ben, missing him each time.

HELEN
Take whatewer you like! The microwave, the TV, anything. Just so you know, the TV has a European plug but it's top of the range - 8K, 10-bit color and all.

BEN
Hold on, what? Didn’t we...you know, last night? I'm really sorry, I don't remember your name.

HELEN
Did we what last night?

Helen chucks more socks Ben's way.

BEN
We met at XOYO. Took Mandy. Ended up back here?

HELEN
XOYO?

BEN
XOYO, the club. DJ Baba was on the decks. He's huge in Germany. And you, your dance moves were...
(realizes)
It wasn’t you, was it? It was a different girl. Petite, fiery red hair, absolutely stunning. She must be your flatmate?

HELEN
It's just me here. And Brooks.

BEN
Brooks, the cat.

HELEN
What cat? Brooks is a guinea pig. I’m allergic to cats.

BEN
Am I still tripping?

A brief flashback of Ben and Helen on a restaurant date flickers past. Recognition dawns on Helen's face.

HELEN
You're Ben, right? It’s me, Helen.

Helen looks at Ben, expecting him to recognize her. Ben draws a blank.

BEN
You do look kind of familiar. Or you just remind me of someone else.

HELEN
Tapas bar, ten years ago? You nearly chocked on a meat skewer. I thought we had a really good time. Minus the almost chocking part.

Ben's expression remains blank.

HELEN
We went on a date. You never called.

BEN
I'm sorry about that.

Ben and Helen stand in an awkward silence.

BEN
I really should get going. Your door is jammed. And the window’s a no-go. 
(realisation strikes him)
Did you kidnap me?

Helen moves to the door to unlock it.

BEN
Were you that upset I didn't call?

HELEN
I didn't kidnap you.

Helen tries the door, but like Ben, finds it immovable.

Helen attemps to open several windows, each refusing to budge.

Suddenly, an ALARM goes off. They spin around and see GRAHAM (70s), in pajamas, dozing on the couch. He stirs awake and reaches over to silence the phone alarm sitting on the coffee table.

Helen goes pale, upon seeing him.

A flashback reveals a younger Graham handing a paper marked with a 'C' to a pleading teenage Helen.

HELEN
Mr. Harry?

Graham appears disoriented.

GRAHAM
Where am I?

BEN
You're at Helen's house. 
(offers his hand)
I'm Ben.

GRAHAM
(shakes Ben's hand)
Graham. And who's Helen?

HELEN
I was in your class. Year eleven. This is too weird. 

BEN
(to Graham)
Were you at XOYO last night?

GRAHAM
I was at home with my wife. I've taught many Helens over the years. One of them was Helen Marlowe. Heard she's done quite well for herself. A PhD in Quantum physics from Oxford. Entrepreneurial, too. Her company attracted an investment from Bill Gates himself. Quite the brainbox, that one.

As Graham talks, Helen's face falls, clearly bothered by the mention of the other Helen's success.

Graham notices the meticulously folded clothes on the coffee table.

GRAHAM
This fold isn’t mine.

Graham dials his phone.

GRAHAM
Claudia, hi, it's me... (listening) I'm alright... (listening) I've ended up at the home of a former student, Helen... (listening) No, not the successful Helen Marlowe, some other Helen...
(to Helen)
Am I kidnapped?

HELEN
No.

GRAHAM
She denies any kidnapping... (listening) Sleepwalking?... (listening) Perhaps a side effect of that new statin I'm on?... (listening) Yes, quite strange indeed...

BEN
(to Helen)
You sure you didn't accidentally kidnap us? Clicked on a dodgy pop-up ad, mistakenly placed a bid on us on eBay?
(seeing Helen's reaction)
No? Just wanted to make sure.

Helen appears nervous and unsteady. She heads towards the bathroom door.

Upon entering the bathroom, Helen discovers STEPHANIE (30s) on the toilet. Their eyes lock for a moment.

A flashback: Stephanie (10), dressed in a makeshift judge's robe.

STEPHANIE
Helen Joan Katy Miller, how do you plead?

Three girls, acting as the court witnesses, point accusatory fingers at a young Helen (10), who sits apart, tears streaming down her face.

HELEN
(through tears)
Not guilty.

Back to the present.

Helen exits the bathroom quickly. Ben notices Helen's shocked face.

BEN
You look like you've seen ghost. Was she the ghost?

HELEN
You're all ghosts.

Stephanie comes out, her demeanor light and cheerful.

STEPHANIE
Well, that was a bit embarrassing, wasn't it? Caught me mid-action!
(extends a friendly hand to Ben)
I'm Steph. And you are?

BEN
Ben. Were you at XOYO last night?

STEPHANIE
Absolutely, I was there. DJ Baba had me bouncing off the walls. Should've brought a wet floor sign with me, if you know what I mean?

Ben is charmed by her. Stephanie turns to Helen, her face icy.

HELEN
Hello, Stephanie. You don't remember me, do you?

Recognition slowly lights up Stephanie's face.

STEPHANIE
Helen? Blimey, it is you! You haven’t changed one bit, have you? It's been ages!

Stephanie briskly pulls a rigid Helen into a warm hug and cheek kiss.

Back to the childhood flashback, the scene unfolds further. One of the girl, ABIGAIL (10) stands, acting as a witness.

ABIGAIL
Helen was staring at Josh for the entire class.

STEPAHNIE
(to Helen)
What do you say in your defense, Helen?

HELEN
I wasn't staring. I was daydreaming. Didn't notice where my eyes wandered.

STEPAHNIE
Were you daydreaming about Josh?

HELEN
No, I wasn't, I swear! I don't even like Josh.

STEPAHNIE
That makes you guilty of lying too, Helen. All girls in school fancy Josh.

The three girls nod in agreement.

Back to the present.

STEPHANIE
Why am I here?
(to Helen)
Did I run into you last night? Sorry, I was completely out of it.

BEN
Helen didn't kidnap you.

Helen dashes into the bathroom and vomits into the toilet. After rinsing her mouth at the sink, she turns to open the cupboard and finds LINDA (40s) crammed inside. Helen jumps back in surprise.

LINDA
Have you seen Rusty?

HELEN
Rusty?

A cat dashes in front of Helen. She starts sneezing uncontrollably.

CUT TO:

The five of them are seated on the couch in the living room, the tension palpable as they wait.

There is a distant meowing.

LINDA
Poor Rusty.

HELEN
(genuinely)
I'm sorry.

BEN
I'm fatally allergic to cashews.

HELEN
(looks at the time on her phone)
It's been half an hour. 
(to Ben)
You should give them another call.

BEN
I'm sure they're just minutes away.

STEPHANIE
(to Helen)
What are you up to these days? 

HELEN
I make websites.

STEPHANIE
Sounds cool! What kind of websites?

HELEN
Boring websites. It's not cool. I have to take Ritalin. At least it's remote.

BEN
What's Ritalin?

STEPHANIE
ADHD med.

LINDA
(to Helen)
You hardly come off as hyper.

STEPHANIE
I'm pretty sure I have ADHD.

Flashback: HELEN (10) sits alone in the canteen, lost in thought as she eats her lunch.

Stephanie and the other three girls from the court approach her table. Stephanie munches on gummies from a bag.

STEPHANIE
Helen?

Helen remains lost in her thoughts, oblivious to their presence. The girls snicker at her apparent unawareness.

STEPHANIE
(tries again, louder)
Helen?

Still no response. Stephanie tosses a gummy at Helen, which lands on her face. Startled, Helen jumps up, knocking over her glass of juice in the process. While the other girls burst into laughter, Stephanie remains serious.

STEPHANIE
The court has reached a verdict on your punishment.

Back to the present.

LINDA
(to Stephanie)
I would say you look more hyper than her.

STEPHANIE
There's this ADHD TikToker I follow. She did a skit about forgetting names as soon as she hears them - laughed my head off. So relatable.

BEN
I'm terrible with names, especially girls' names. Think I've got ADHD too?

LINDA
Seems like everyone's got a bit of ADHD these days. I used to love reading, but now if an article takes longer than a minute, I'm out. Blame it on those tiny screens.

STEPHANIE
No, that's different. I'm always late for everything.

BEN
After a night out, I'm always late for work, which pretty much means every day.

Helen reacts to the conversation with a sour expression.

GRAHAM
It seems disorders have become quite fasnionable, hasn't it? Every student now comes with a label - attention deficit, dyslexia, dyscalculia. Back in the day we just called it bad at math.

A flashback. Helen (15) stands in front of a younger Graham in the classroom.

HELEN
I get the disk method. I made a stupid mistake. I wrote "x to the fourth" instead of "x to the fifth."

GRAHAM
In calculus, understanding means getting the integrations right, not making excuses for mistakes.

HELEN
(pleading)
I misread my own handwriting.

Back to the present.

LINDA
Speaking of which, no one remembers how we got here.

BEN
Perhaps it's an elaborate prank on Helen that we all unknowingly signed up for? You know, by blindly agreeing to the terms and conditions.

LOCKSMITH
What is the address again?

HELEN
____

LOCKSMITH
I just don't see any house here. It's an empty piece of land.

HELEN
You're right in front of it!

BEN
We can see you. You're wearing a blue T-shirt.

LOCKSMITH
I followed Google maps and ended up here in the middle of nowhere. I can't help you if I can't see your house. You don't need to worry about Brooks. He's with me.

HELEN
What what did he say?

They can now see that the Locksmith is holding Brooks with one hand.

LOCKSMITH
Helen can't stop thinking about your night together 10 years ago. She recoils at the thought of letting you touch her. She didn't fancy you that much but she wanted to be liked.

Helen runs and hangs up the phone. They keep banging at the windows and suddenly the daylight outside is replaced with the nighttime with the moon.
